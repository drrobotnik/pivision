# PiVision (WIP)

This is an adaptation of p5vision public repo. The intention of this project is to implement as a handsfree interface using voice recognition (Snowboy) and to reduce the dependency on the cloud. Future goals will be to fallback on cloud recognition and to store the failed positives to then regenerate and improve our recognition model. Ultimately run on a Raspberry Pi Zero with camera module.

## Featuring
Hot and Action word detection, Speech to text, text to intent (LUIS), computer vision and emotion analysis through a Node server running a P5 based client.
